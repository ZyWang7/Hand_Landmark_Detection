# Keypoints
kpt_shape: [21, 3]  # number of keypoints, number of dims (2 for x,y or 3 for x,y,visible)

# flip_idx -> needed when the points are symmetric
# For example -> if we assume five keypoints of facial landmark:
# [left eye, right eye, nose, left mouth, right mouth]
# and original index is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# => then flip_idx is [1, 0, 2, 4, 3] (just exchange the left-right index
# flip_idx: [0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 12, 11, 14, 13, 16, 15]
